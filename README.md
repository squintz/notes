A personal collection of my learnings

For years I have collected my notes in random places including unsaved Notepad++ files and Google Docs. Google Docs works ok for notes but they often get lost in the vast abyss of other files and therefore I never revisit them. This repository is my attempt at getting a bit more organized.

## My Interest

These are some of the topics you might find here.

* Electronics
* Programming (desktop and embedded)
* Reverse Engineering
* Window Drivers
* Random Quotes (I like quotes but can never remember them)
* Math (Always trying to improve my math skills)
